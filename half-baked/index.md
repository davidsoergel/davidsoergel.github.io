Like many technologists, I have a pile of partially formed ideas for projects and products that I think would be cool, but that I haven&#8217;t got off the ground yet. They&#8217;re described in individual posts, but here is an attempt to make sense of them in the aggregate.

Please do [let me know][1] if you think one of these would be worth actually doing; if you&#8217;d like to work on it; if you&#8217;ve already scooped it; if you&#8217;d like to fund it; and so forth!
